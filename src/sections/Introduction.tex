\section{Introduction}
\subsection{The objective of this guide}
Hello fellow reader, you're probably reading this guide wondering:
``What's the difference between this guide and any other \LaTeX{} guide?''.
Well for one, this guide isn't \LaTeX{} documentation;
it'll be a waste of time and effort to write documentation while there are a lot of good ones already.
We really recommend using \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Main_Page}{Overleaf's Documentation},
which is our favorite resource for learning \LaTeX{}.
This guide is tailored to IB students who have an idea on what \LaTeX{} is,
and would like to use it for their Internal Assessments or their Extended Essay.
This guide will mainly present the different tools generally used for writing your documents.
It will also contain boilerplate for things that might be a bit annoying to write,
as well as packages that are helpful for writing your documents and getting that 7 the \sout{best} \LaTeX{} way.

\subsection{Documentation and IDEs}
Before you go on, we assume that you already know basic \LaTeX{}.
If not, here's a list of good resources for learning:
\begin{itemize}
\item \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Main_Page}{Overleaf's Documentation}:
Honestly, best documentation ever.
You'll use it always and we will reference it a lot throughout this guide.
We highly recommend you using this.
\item \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhmkLrOjLsw}{Derek Banas' Youtube video}:
If you don't know Derek Banas, here's what you have to know.
He's good at summarizing things, and this video covers a lot of \LaTeX{}'s documentation.
\end{itemize}

To write \LaTeX{} documents, you're gonna need an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
\href{https://beebom.com/best-latex-editors/}{Here}'s a link to a website that breaks down the most common used IDEs,
from where you can choose one you like or suits you.
