\section{Setting up and Structuring}
\subsection{Useful packages}
Once you have your environment set up,
you're gonna have to add packages and configure things
in the preamble in order to respect the guidelines
(things like double spacing and whatnot).
Below is a example of what you generally will need in a preamble.
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[a4paper, 12pt]{article}

%Paragraph jumps and indentation
\setlength{\parskip}{1.6em}
\setlength{\parindent}{1.25cm}

%Border
\usepackage[left=1in, right=1in, top=1in, bottom=1in]{geometry}

%Double spacing
\usepackage{setspace}
\doublespacing

%Packages
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage[dvipsnames]{xcolor}
\usepackage{mathtools}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
\usepackage{titlesec}

%Images
\usepackage{graphicx}
\graphicspath{ {./images/} }
\usepackage{wrapfig}
\usepackage{float}

%Tables
\usepackage{multirow}
\usepackage{array}
\usepackage{tabu}

\titleformat{\section}
{\normalfont\large\bfseries}{\thesection}{1em}{}
\titleformat{\subsection}
{\normalfont\large\bfseries}{\thesubsection}{1em}{}

%Equation numbering
\counterwithin{equation}{section}

\usepackage{hyperref}
\urlstyle{same}
\end{verbatim}
Now a lot of those are quite straightforward and are just there to save time.
This is the point of this guide, to save you some time.
Packages related to tables and images will be talked about in later sections of this guide.

\verb|\usepackage[dvipsnames]{xcolor}| allows you to color your text,
which is generally useful for links since they aren't automatically colored.
More details over on \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Using_colours_in_LaTeX}{Overleaf's page}.

\verb|\usepackage{amsmath}| add maths symbols and environments like matrices,
while\\ \verb|\usepackage{mathtools}| adds tools to make things like long fractions aesthetically pleasing.
More details on mathtools are over on
\href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Articles/Mathtools_-_for_beautiful_math}{Overleaf's page}.

\verb|\usepackage{titlesec}| allows you to configure the space between sections and subsections.
It's also used if you want to customize your sections or subsections.
We've used it in the example above (starting from \verb|\titleformat{\section}|)
to reduce the space after sections.
Since you have a hard 12 page limit in your G4 IAs,
might as well remove any unnecessary space before reducing word count.

\verb|\usepackage{hyperref}| allows you to add hyperlinks in your document,
whether those are for navigating your documents or to link websites.
We're using this right now to link you to
\href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Hyperlinks}{Overleaf's documentation on hyperlinks}.

That's not all! There are other useful packages for G4 subjects,
which don't need to be in every preamble.

We recommend using \verb|\usepackage{siunitx}| when it comes to writing a physics IA,
since it provides a straightforward way to use SI and other units.
Which can be pretty handy.

We recommend using \verb|\usepackage[version=4]{mhchem}| for writing chemical reactions and formulas.
However, we (\href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Chemistry_formulae}{and Overleaf})
recommend using \verb|\usepackage{chemfig}| for drawing molecules and other figures.
